### Inception of open-source EDA, OpenLANE and Sky130 PDK
#### Theory-

QFN-48 Package: It's a small package used for computer chips. The "48" indicates it has 48 connection points.
Chip: Also called as an integrated circuit (IC) or microchip, a chip is a small semiconductor device that contains electronic circuits etched onto a tiny piece of silicon.
Pads: These are metal spots on the chip that act as connection points to communicate with other parts of a device.
Core: The core of an integrated circuit typically refers to the central processing unit of the chip.
Die: The die is the individual part of the chip before it's installed into a device.
IPs: These are pre-designed blocks used in chip creation, similar to pre-made Lego pieces that help speed up the chip design process.
RISC-V: It is a free and open instruction set architecture (ISA) enabling a new era of processor innovation through open standard collaboration.
Application software to Hardware:
      ->Application software directly interacts with system software, including the operating system (OS), compilers, and assemblers, to access hardware resources 
      efficiently.
      ->The OS manages hardware resources and provides essential services, while compilers and assemblers translate high-level code into machine code i.e., it converts 
      to binary codes and feeds to the hardware
