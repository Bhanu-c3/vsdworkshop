#### Theory-

QFN-48 Package: It's a small package used for computer chips. The "48" indicates it has 48 connection points.

Chip: Also called as an integrated circuit (IC) or microchip, a chip is a small semiconductor device that contains electronic circuits etched onto a tiny piece of silicon.

Pads: These are metal spots on the chip that act as connection points to communicate with other parts of a device.

Core: The core of an integrated circuit typically refers to the central processing unit of the chip.

Die: The die is the individual part of the chip before it's installed into a device.

IPs: These are pre-designed blocks used in chip creation, similar to pre-made Lego pieces that help speed up the chip design process.

RISC-V: It is a free and open instruction set architecture (ISA) enabling a new era of processor innovation through open standard collaboration.

Application software to Hardware:
      ->Application software directly interacts with system software, including the operating system (OS), compilers, and assemblers, to access hardware resources 
      efficiently.
      
      ->The OS manages hardware resources and provides essential services, while compilers and assemblers translate high-level code into machine code i.e., it converts to binary codes and feeds to the hardware

RTL2GDS Flow:

- Synthesis: Converting high-level design specifications into a gate-level representation for hardware implementation.
  
- Floorplanning: Strategically arranging functional blocks on a chip's surface to optimize performance, power, and area usage.
  
- Placement: Assigning physical positions to logic cells or functional blocks within the chip's area to optimize interconnections.
  
- Clock Tree Synthesis: Creating a network of clock distribution paths to ensure uniform clock signal delivery across the chip, minimizing timing discrepancies.
  
- Routing: Determining optimal paths for interconnecting logical elements on the chip to establish functional connectivity while meeting timing and power constraints.
